Days pass by and my eyes they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Till I find myself in conversation fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk, the time you took
To teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost
